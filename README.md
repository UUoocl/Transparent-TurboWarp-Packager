# Transparent-TurboWarp-Packager
The [TurboWarp Packager](https://github.com/TurboWarp/packager) modified to remove the background.

Use [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) or [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) projects as overlays.  

When creating a project replace the Backdrop with a transparent image.  Try the PNG in this repo for example. 

Save the scratch project as an ".sb3" file. 

Use the Packager from this repo to convert the ".sb3" file to ".html"
